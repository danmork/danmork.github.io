In section 6.5.4, Design of Media Types, of Roy Fielding's *Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures* dissertation, Mr. Fielding writes:

> Architectural mismatches due to misplaced application state are not limited to HTTP cookies. The introduction of “frames” to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) caused similar confusion. Frames allow a browser window to be partitioned into subwindows, each with its own navigational state. Link selections within a subwindow are indistinguishable from normal transitions, but the resulting response representation is rendered within the subwindow instead of the full browser application workspace. This is fine provided that no link exits the realm of information that is intended for subwindow treatment, but when it does occur the user finds themself viewing one application wedged within the subcontext of another application.
