John and I have been writing web apps together for many years. We are constantly trying to find better ways to build web apps. We tried SOAP and it wasn't great. We tried what people were calling REST and it was better, but it still wasn't great. We realized that the parts of these technologies that weren't great was the parts that didn't conform to the way the web works.

We started to dig deeper into web architecture. We read Roy Fielding's dissertation, *Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures*. It is not easy reading. So we read it again. We kept reading it and discussing it. It became clear to us that hypermedia was the missing ingredient that caused our prior experiences with web technologies to be not so great. Hypermedia was what made the web work.

We started to learn more about hypermedia. This took us down the road of hypermedia services.

> A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types.
